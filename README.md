# Tech Blog<br>![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)
## Description
This blog website allows users to create accounts and post blogs about different thoughts they have about tech and exchange ideas with other users on the platform. When you enter the site, you come to a home page with users' posts and options on the navigation bar to execute different actions. However, to post, you must either log in or create an account if you haven't done so yet. Once that is done, the user is given the ability to comment on others' posts, make a new post, or delete or update posts and comments that they have created. The user can go to their own personal dashboard as well, and view just their own posts. If they are done on the site, they can log out or, if they remain idle for too long of a period, then they will be logged out by the site.
